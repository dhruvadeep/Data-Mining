    "Visualization is a key component of exploration. You will generate some charts to get some intuition about the data. You can choose to use either Matplotlib or Seaborn for plotting. The default figures generated from Matplotlib might look a bit ugly. So you might want to try Seaborn to get better figures. The defaults in Seaborn are much saner and sometimes makes your life lot easier. Seaborn has number of styles - so feel free to experiment with them and choose the one you like. \n"
