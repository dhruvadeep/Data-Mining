# Instructions for Programming Assignment 1

Almost all of the instructions for programming assignment 1 is given as a series of IPython notebooks. However, before you get around running these notebooks, you have to do lot of setup. So, I have provided a HTML version of the notebooks that can be viewed in the browser.

Using this, you should be able to follow the instructions to get a working JupyterLab setup. Once it is done, you should be able to get the notebook up and running and follow the instructions within each of the notebook. Start with 01_environment_setup and proceed to the rest of the assignments.

If you have any doubts, please ask in the Moodle forum.
