    "In this assignment, you will use the FEC dataset. The US Federal Election Commission publishes data on contributions to political campaigns. This includes contributor names, occupation and employer, address, and contribution amount. Specifically, we will be using the FEC data from 2012 election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. This is widely considered as a landmark election as both sides spent an unprecedented amount of 1 Billion dollars each (i.e. at current exchange rates, more than 8000 Crores in INR each). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested, you can download the entire list of contributor details at the FEC site. It is relatively large (150 MB compressed, 1 GB uncompressed). For our experiments, we will use a smaller subset of the data collected (and cleaned) by Wes McKinney (the creator of Pandas). It is small by most standards (around 1.4 million records, 20 MB compressed, 160 MB uncompressed) but large enough to give a taste of why data mining is compute intensive. Hopefully, this will also give you an appreciation as to the awesomeness of Pandas/Numpy - you can do really cool stuff with 2-3 lines of code that runs in seconds. This also gives us some option to evaluate emerging tools such as Modin and Duckdb that can make analysis even easier. \n",

Since DuckDB resides in the same process, it avoids copying data resulting in blazing fast operations. \n",

Embedded databases such as SQLite and DuckDB are much simpler. All the data resides in a single file. DuckDB does something even cool. It has a set of adaptors that allows you to use the DuckDB engine for querying and get the data from somewhere else. For example, you can query a csv file or a SQLite file or a Postgres database without creating an intermediate DuckDB database. In this task, we will create an in-memory database of the FEC dataset.\n",

The traditional way of creating a database from a CSV file will be to create a DB with a given schema, read the CSV file line and then insert that line into the DB. This adds friction. DuckDB allows you to create a DB from csv file directly. It uses lot of heuristics to infer the schema and data types. Hint: check the `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT *` and the `read_csv_auto` functions.\n",

    "Third, we will do some basic querying over this constructed database. Specifically, we will do couple of the tasks that you did for the pandas version. \n",
